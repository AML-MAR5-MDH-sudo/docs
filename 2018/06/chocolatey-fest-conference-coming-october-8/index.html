    <p>It’s been a big year already for Chocolatey Software! We've expanded our staff, we're launching our Chocolatey Central Management for Chocolatey for Business, and have started a philanthropy for giving back to our community. We were also officially recognized by Microsoft at the recent Microsoft BUILD 2018 conference and now <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/05/08/join-us-for-a-hot-cup-o-chocolatey/">Microsoft is participating/collaborating in our community!</a> Details on all those exciting areas are going to be coming out in the coming weeks, but we wanted to take a moment to give you a heads up about what we have in store that is really the Chocolatey icing on the cake!</p>
<img src="/assets/images/chocolatey-fest-announce.png" alt="Chocolatey Fest - A sweet conference focused on Windows automation (WinOps)! 08 October 2018, Park Central Hotel, San Francisco" title="Chocolatey Fest 2018 - join us for awesome talks, some actual chocolate, and maybe even an appearance by Willy Wonka!" align="right" />
<p>We're excited to officially announce that <a href="https://chocolateyfest.com">Chocolatey Fest 2018</a> is coming to San Francisco on October 8, 2018. We’re bringing that Chocolatey goodness to Park Central Hotel near Union Square, and we hope you’ll join us. Chocolatey Fest will be the first ever independent conference in North America focused exclusively on Windows automation (WinOps)!</p>
<p>Even as a one day event this year, Chocolatey Fest promises a packed schedule, including keynotes on the future of WinOps from Chocolatey Software and organizations focused heavily on Microsoft Windows automation. Come to learn about WinOps as it relates to areas such as infrastructure as code, testing your infrastructure, and the future of where the industry is going. Come to meet other folks focused in Windows automation and some of the exciting things they are working on. Windows automation is at a really exciting turning point and you are right in the middle of it!  It's likely you will hear talks and be involved in discussions featuring technologies such as Vagrant, Docker, Puppet, Chef, Azure, AWS, Ansible, and others.</p>
<p>Your time (and budget) is limited, and we know you have to make decisions when it comes to which conferences you attend each year. What sets Chocolatey Fest apart? We have a tight-knit community of engineers - together we’re building the future of Windows automation, and finding ways to make our work scalable, secure, and fun again. Who knows? You may even find Willy Wonka at Chocolatey Fest!</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t hurt that our ticket price is more competitive than most. Plus, if you’re among the first 50 registrants, you’ll save 20%.</p>
<p><a href="https://chocolateyfest.com/register">Get your Golden Ticket now!</a></p>
<p>Your ticket includes access to all keynotes, presentations and meals, and an optional evening hackathon and workshop. Plus, you’ll get a chance to catch up with friends and meet members of the Chocolatey and WinOps community and Chocolatey Software's team.</p>
